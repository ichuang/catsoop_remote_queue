# catsoop_remote_queue

This repository provides files to enable catsoop to provide "remote help queue" functionality.

This assumes you're using a catsoop_queue node.js server that has been suitably modified.

## Installation

1. Put the `remote_queue` directory and its files, into the top level of your catsoop installation
2. Edit your `catsoop-queue/www/templates/student_view.html` file and make sure it has the same content as [student_view.html](catsoop-queue/www/templates/student_view.html)
